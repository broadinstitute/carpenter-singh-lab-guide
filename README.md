# Carpenter-Singh Lab Guide

Resources and standards for the Carpenter-Singh Lab at the Broad Institute.

This guide documents lab-specific SOPs, best practices, and key information for lab members. Please contribute additional guides, patterns, and standards as we develop them.

> [!NOTE]
> **Documentation Philosophy**: These guides follow a dense-over-verbose approach targeting expert data scientists new to our lab. They are prescriptive rather than exploratory, providing "the lab way" with executable commands over explanations. For comprehensive details on underlying tools and concepts, consult the original documentation ([CCDS](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/), etc.).

It complements other resources:

- [Imaging Platform wiki](https://new.ipwiki.app/) (general knowledge base) 🔒
- [Carpenter–Singh Lab Policy and Culture](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/lab_policy) (focused on values and responsibilities)

- Imaging Platform Onboarding checklist (per-person template) 🔒
